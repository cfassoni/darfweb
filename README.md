# The DARFweb Project

DARFweb is a free and open-source web application designed to help Brazilian
investors calculate and generate their DARF (Documento de Arrecadação de
Receitas Federais) forms for tax payments related to investments. The project
aims to simplify the process of tax compliance for individual investors by
providing an easy-to-use interface and accurate calculations based on the latest
tax regulations.
